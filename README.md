📊 PhonePe Digital Payments – Data Analysis Case Study
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of digital payment trends in India using data inspired by PhonePe Pulse.
The goal of the study is to understand transaction behaviour, identify growth patterns, and derive key insights using Python-based analytics.
🚀 Project Overview
In this case study, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis on India’s digital payments landscape.
The notebook includes:
✔ Data ingestion & preprocessing
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Trend analysis: Transactions, user growth & geography-wise performance
✔ Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
✔ Insights and recommendations based on real-world digital payment patterns
🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualizations
Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Insights Highlight
Some major insights derived from the analysis include:
🔹 Strong growth in digital transactions across major Indian states
🔹 High contribution from Tier-1 cities
🔹 Seasonal peaks during festivals and sale periods
🔹 Significant rise in UPI adoption across rural regions
(Modify these based on your actual notebook findings.)
📊 Visualizations
The notebook contains multiple graphs, including:
Line charts for transaction growth
State-wise bar plots
Distribution plots for user activity
Comparative heatmaps
These help in understanding usage behaviour and regional performance.
